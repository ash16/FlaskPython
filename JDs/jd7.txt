• Enabling organisations in government and regulated sectors to realise the true benefit of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS architectures on Azure for mission critical workloads 
• Drive engineering relationships alongside field-based engineering resources, customers and partners to fully understand and learn from the customer experience end-to-end on the Azure platform 
• Providing architectural guidance for Azure solutions through interaction with technical audiences 
• Designing and reviewing Azure architectural solutions including: 
o On premises to cloud migrations 
o Hybrid data centre architectures 
o Secure, multi-layered virtual cloud infrastructure

o Information security compliance and assurance processes for Australia & New Zealand government and regulated sectors 
o Cybersecurity controls and frameworks for deployment of secure enclaves, gateways and restricted administration environments.
o Broad knowledge of cloud infrastructure and networking
o Mission-critical legacy platform modernisation 
o Working with Microsoft Azure engineering product and field engineering teams as well as field account teams to understand requirements, design, and review solutions, and deploy these into Pilots, Proof of Concept, and Production environments. 

As Microsoft continues to expand global infrastructure to serve the needs of Australia and New Zealand, you will help to accelerate our strategic customer's adoption of the Microsoft Azure platform. You’ll do that by bringing your deep technical experiences, your program and project management ability, your stakeholder management skills and your technical expertise. You will contribute directly into the engineering product teams, helping to ensure Azure is well aligned with the most compelling workloads and scenarios from each sector. As a Senior PM your primary responsibility is to work within defined sectors with a select set of customers and partners to guide initiatives for differentiation and rapid adoption.

#Qualifications
The ideal candidate will have:
• experience in customer facing roles as well as engagement with engineering and product development teams; and
• success leading discussions with senior customer and partner executives; and 
• the ability to think and operate broadly, driving key decisions and implementation; and
• strength in identifying and translating abstract customer scenarios and workloads into concrete product refinements; and
• strong credibility to engage on cybersecurity threats, risks and countermeasures; and 
• presentation experience, public speaking skills and strong communication abilities; and 
• a growth mindset with a desire to experiment, learn and adapt to challenging situations

Desired technical skills for this role include: 
• Ability to architect and implement cloud security controls, especially within Microsoft Azure and/or Amazon Web Services 
• Ability to perform threat and risk assessment, interpret and communicate compliance controls and multiple layers of a cloud platform 
• Solid solution architecture and development skills—you will need to be able to deliver deep technical content and at the same time bridge that technical knowledge with mature, business discussions 
• Be familiar with ARM Templates, Powershell scripts, C#/JS/Python, architectural design patterns, and agile methodologies 

Success in this role depends on collaboration with generalists and specialists in Microsoft engineering as well as the Microsoft field and delivery teams (including partners, services, and business development). This role will be based in Canberra, Australia. Moderate travel will be required (20-30%).
