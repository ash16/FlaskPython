Do you want to be part of Microsoft's journey in making Azure successful? Enterprises are a huge focus in Microsoft's strategy for Azure, and our team at IDC builds a suite of management services that are focused on helping enterprises modernize their datacenters, move to the public cloud and manage their assets in the cloud.  
Backup is one of the top workloads picked by enterprises to adopt the public cloud, and Azure Backup is our management service offering for them. We build on-premises, hybrid, and cloud backup solutions that aim to disrupt the traditional on-premises backup segment (worth billions of dollars!) and lead in providing  backup solutions for all emerging public cloud assets. We are building world class solutions to help protect any workload (VMs, SQL, Oracle, File Server etc.) running on any cloud (private, hosted, Azure, AWS, etc.) and hypervisor (Hyper-V, VMware). Our solutions already manage hundreds of petabytes of data in the backend across hundreds of thousands of data sources - and we are just at the beginning of this journey.
 
We build highly scalable multitenant PaaS solutions consisting of loosely coupled micro services integrated with Azure Portal that allows customers to centrally and consistently manage and monitor workloads across all clouds in a single place. Our team offers the opportunity to learn how to build and run a world class Azure service from industry experts and go as broad or as deep as you like, with a technology stacks that spans kernel mode, databases, user mode and UX components, different OS's (Windows and Linux), different hypervisors (VMWare, HyperV), and different clouds (Azure, AWS)! We follow an agile monthly sprint model with strong Live Site and customer focus. We want smart, motivated engineers who have a passion for design, coding and debugging, being data driven, and efficiency in building services of high quality. If you enjoy taking risks, learning from mistakes, love to tackle hard engineering challenges, and want to make real, continuous, customer impact, then this is the group for you!
