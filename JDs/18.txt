Do you want to work on the cutting edge of Cloud Computing, create the system that makes millions of machines look like one big cloud, build highly scalable disturbed systems? Do you want to be part of the next big wave in the industry, be part of a fast paced, high energy team? Being an integral part of Azure, the IDC team builds parts of all the critical components. Our focus is to build fully automated and highly scalable solutions for effective capacity management and utilization of resources in the data center, ease of deployment of services, simplifying monitoring, debugging and troubleshooting of services, and optimizing the platform for reliability and performance.   The Azure team designs and builds the software platform that powers millions of servers in datacenters around the globe, providing core infrastructure software services for properties like Bing, Xbox, SQL, Messenger. Engineers in this team work on solving some of the most complex and challenging problems in distributed systems, for example: - System that dynamically allocates computing resources, balances load, detects failure automatically, repairs and recovers erroneous applications, manages application deployment, and updates application data safely, quickly, and frequently. 
The platform furthermore provides foundational services such as messaging, queuing, storage, and caching services to enable rich application services for Microsoft.   - Internet of Things (IoT) - the next major wave of computing, from working with standard protocols like AMQP, MQTT or WebSockets, to building massively distributed messaging and compute systems designed for IoT - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - a highly decentralized autonomous platform that cleanly abstracts and effectively solves hard distributed systems problems like failure detection, leader election, replicated state machines, etc. and makes it easy to develop and manage stateless and stateful reliable micro-services running at high-density on shared pool of machines.
This platform powers many critical 1st and 3rd party internet scale services and runs symmetrically in cloud and on premises. - Systems that scale and perform in almost all dimensions - millions of transactions per second with multiple GB/s ingress and egress with sub-second end-to-end latency, systems that run across tens or hundreds of thousands of machines, and handle petabytes of data, etc. - Integration ecosystem - support clients running on various hardware form factors and integrate with different backend systems like Hadoop, Storm, Azure Stream Analytics, Cosmos, etc.
 
The Azure India Team is looking for highly motivated and talented engineers to design and deliver the next generation platform for all of these. Huge challenges of scale and extensibility await, and it is an exciting place to grow and have a significant contribution with immediate worldwide impact. We are focusing on app platform, data platform and the machine learning opportunities it unlocks. We are a fun and fast paced environment (we ship every week!), where developers are empowered to innovate.
