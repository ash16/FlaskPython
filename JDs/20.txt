Are you committed to ensuring your customers are delighted every single day and can rest at ease knowing their data is secured?  Then please consider joining Microsoft as a Site Reliability Engineer.
 
As a Sr. Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) in the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) group you’ll build solutions that boost the reliability, performance and security of Microsoft’s developer services and automate and simplify how we work.  You may spend weeks collaborating with other engineers to design and deliver solutions for disaster recovery, capacity management, monitoring, telemetry, and platform automation.  Then you’ll get to dive deep on investigations that stretch your skills as you traverse rich telemetry streams to isolate and solve complex performance and reliability issues.  We’re looking for someone who has the awareness to see where things are broken, the imagination to envision how best to improve, and the technical and collaboration skills needed to deliver solutions that measurably strengthen our services. We’re also looking for individuals who deeply value working as team and succeeding together. 
 
Luck favors the prepared and your ongoing training and experimentation in our failure mode environments helps ensure production outages are a rarity.  When they do occur, you’ll help us respond by providing the leadership and structure needed across our DevOps team, to ensure quick mitigation.  Our culture is focused on transparency and being open to learning from our mistakes in a spirit of improvement without blame.  With equal doses of confidence and humility, we continually strive to see where we can improve.
Imagine that you have an exclusive backstage pass to one of world’s largest cloud platforms used by teams and companies around the world.  What kind of skills, relationships and insights would you develop if your daily job provided you with insider access to the teams that engineer and run Azure and Microsoft’s developer services? 
 
We collaborate very closely with Azure to design, operate and optimize large-scale, online services used by teams and companies across the globe.  Within our developer services we continually innovate and push technology to the limit with both our scale and design.  Our Site Reliability Engineers are focused on our customers and the service design that enables them to trust us.  As we drive the maturity of our service we regularly influence and/or contribute to improvements into both our services and the Azure platform, knowing these improvements positively affect so many customers and users around the world is a pretty good feeling.
 
Within Microsoft’s Developer Division (DevDiv) we envision, create, and run a broad array of online services used by developers and teams around the world (view our story here https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/vsts-jobs/).  Our services run at a massive scale and continue to grow.  They are built over both public and private clouds and have been architected with common capabilities and patterns that help us to operate consistently and efficiently. We’ve learned a lot about running large scale services over the last several years and we continue to learn every day – this is where we need your help.  We are looking for special individuals who bring a unique set of experiences and skills to our group and who will help us grow and mature.
